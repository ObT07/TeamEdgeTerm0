# TeamEdgeTerm0
Javascript challenges for Google's Code Next Team Edge Program. These challenges are defined in the **master** branch, and solved in the **solutions** branch of this repo: https://github.com/CodeNextAdmin/TeamEdgeTerm0/tree/solutions

Each challenge contains detailed instructions in the body of the .js file. 

### Usage:
Clone the repo to a Teamn Edge directory on your computer, or Raspberry Pi.

**Make sure to have Node.js and the readline-sync package, which is used to get input in the Terminal:** 

- [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). When you're done installing Node or to check if you have it installed, open a terminal and enter this command:

`$ node -v`

- To add packages, you must also install NPM (Node Package Manager)
Install NPM: 
` $ npm init --yes`

- Readline-sync package:
  ` $ npm install readline-sync`
 
Once you have confirmed this setup, you can navigate to the  directory where you cloned things to, if needed, and run each file in the terminal with Node.js. `$ node name-of-file.js `
